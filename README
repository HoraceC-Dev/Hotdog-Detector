# Hotdog Detector

This project leverages the pre-existing YOLO v8n model to build a Hotdog Detector by fine-tuning it with a dataset of approximately 3,000 images and corresponding labels. The model undergoes supervised learning in an attempt to maximize its capability and feature extraction tailored to hotdogs. Hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, patience tolerance, and weight decay are tested and well-tuned. As a result, the model is capable of correctly identifying one or more hotdogs in a given image.
